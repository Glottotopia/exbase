\exg. luʔ-ma=na, eko aniŋ=ga liŋkha=ga.\\
tell{\sc -inf[deont]=nmlz.sg} one {\sc 1du.excl.poss=gen} a\_clan{\sc=gen}\\
It has to be told, one (story) about our Linkha clan.


\exg. aniŋ=ga liŋkha=ga uhile utpatti mamliŋ=be leks-a=na=bu.\\
{\sc 1du.excl.poss=gen} a\_clan{\sc =gen} long\_time\_ago origin Mamling{\sc =loc} happen{\sc -pst[3sg]=nmlz.sg=hsy}\\
Our Linkha clan originated long ago in Mamling, they say.


\exg. mamliŋ=bhaŋ wan=ne uhile liŋkha=ci nam=nuŋ bagari n-jog-a, ŋ-ga-ya, bagari.\\
Mamling{\sc =abl} exist{\sc [3sg]=nmlz.sg} long\_time\_ago a\_clan{\sc =nsg} {\sc sun=com} bet {\sc 3pl-}do{\sc -pst} {\sc 3pl-}say{\sc -pst} bet\\
The Linkhas from Mamling, long ago they had a bet with the sun, they said, a bet.


\exg. bagari n-joga, nhaŋ bagari n-jog-a=niŋa, nna liŋkha=ga, uk=ka u-pik=ci waisa=bu, nhaŋ pik=ci chuʔ-ni-ma pʌrne, luŋkhwak hoŋ-ma pʌrne, nhaŋ khibak=ca ip-ni-ma pʌrne sa=bu.\\
bet {\sc 3pl-}do{\sc -pst} and\_then bet {\sc 3pl-}do{\sc -pst=ctmp} that a\_clan{\sc =gen} {\sc 3sg.poss=gen} {\sc 3sg.poss-}cow{\sc =nsg} {\sc cop.pst[3]=hsy} and\_then cow{\sc =nsg} tie{\sc -compl-inf[deont]} having\_to stone make\_hole{\sc -inf[deont]} having\_to and\_then rope{\sc =add} twist{\sc -compl-inf[deont]} having\_to {\sc cop.pst=hsy}\\
They made a bet, and as they made a bet, that Linkha, he had cows, it is said, and he had to tie the cows, he had to hole out a stone, and he had to complete making a rope, too, it is said.


\exg. nam a-ya=niŋa, uŋci=ga hon=na leks-a, ceʔya.\\
sun descend{\sc -pst[3sg]=ctmp} {\sc 3nsg.poss=gen} that\_very{\sc =nmlz.sg} happen{\sc -pst[3sg]} matter\\
During sunset, they settled that matter.


\exg. nhaŋ nam wandikŋa lom-meʔ=niŋa hoŋkhiŋ cok-ni-ma pʌrne sa=bu.\\
and\_then sun next\_day come\_out{\sc -npst[3sg]=ctmp} that\_much do{\sc -compl-inf[deont]} having\_to {\sc cop.pst=hsy}\\
And then, during the dawn of the next day, all that work had to be finished, it is said.


\exg. khaʔniŋgo liŋkha ekdam cog-a=nuŋ cog-a=nuŋ, hakok=ŋa bis wora, ikhiŋ, khibak=ca ipt-i-ci, ka-ya=na anusar.\\
but a\_clan very do{\sc -pst[3sg]=com.cl} do{\sc -pst[3sg]=com.cl} later{\sc =ins} twenty {\sc clf} how\_many rope{\sc =add} twist{\sc -compl-3nsg.P} say{\sc -pst[3sg]=nmlz.sg} according\_to\\
But the Linkha, he worked and worked, he wove twenty ropes, according to what had been said.



\exg. nhaŋ, luŋkhwak=ca hoks-i, nhaŋ luŋkhwak hoks-i=hoŋ, nhaŋ pik=ca chuʔ-i-ci=niŋa=go, eko=chen=go lukt-a-khy-a=na=bu, pik, goru.\\
and\_then stone{\sc =add} make\_hole{\sc -compl[3.P]} and\_then stone make\_hole{\sc -compl[3.P]=seq} and\_then cow{\sc =add} tie{\sc -compl-3nsg.P=ctmp=top} one{\sc =top=top} run{\sc -pst-V2.go-pst[3sg]=nmlz.sg=hsy} cow buffalo\\
And then he also completed holing out the stone, and as he completed holing out the stone,  then, while he completed tying the cows, one cow, one of them ran away, it is said. A cow, a  buffalo.


\exg. lukt-a-khy-a=hoŋ, chuʔ-ma ŋ-gaks-a-n=oŋ, nhaŋ nna wa bhale ka-ya-khy-a.\\
run{\sc -pst-V2.go-pst[3sg]=seq} tie{\sc -inf} {\sc neg-}accept{\sc -pst[3sg]-neg=seq} and\_then that chicken rooster call{\sc -pst-V2.go-pst[3sg]}\\
It ran away, it was not willing to be tied; and then the cock already crowed.

\exg. wa bhale ka-ya=hoŋ, ekchin=ŋa pheri nam=ca lond-a-by-a, nhaŋ liŋkha baji=be har-a cog-a=na.\\
chicken rooster call{\sc -pst[3sg]=seq} one\_moment{\sc =ins} again sun{\sc =add} come\_out{\sc -pst-V2.give-pst[3sg]} and\_then a\_clan bet{\sc =loc} lose{\sc -nativ} do{\sc -pst[3sg]=nmlz.sg}\\
\largerpage[4]
As the cock crowed, in one moment the sun came out, too,  and so the Linkha lost in the bet.


\exg. har-a cog-a=na, i=na om, har-a cog-a, nam=ŋa he=co, nam=ŋa he-co=hoŋ, liŋkha sarap pi=na.\\
lose{\sc -nativ} do{\sc -nativ=nmlz.sg} what{\sc =nmlz.sg} cop lose{\sc -nativ} do{\sc -pst[3sg]} sun{\sc =erg} win{\sc -V2.eat[3.P;pst]} sun{\sc =erg} win{\sc -V2.eat[3.P;pst]=seq} a\_clan spell give{\sc [3.A;3.P]=nmlz.sg}\\
He lost, what is it (comment to herself), he lost, the sun won, and as the sun won, it put a spell on the Linkha.


\exg. gali, thind-u=na.\\
swearwords, rant\_at{\sc -3.P[pst]=nmlz.sg}\\
It cursed him, and scolded him.


\exg. nhaŋ issi=ya ceʔya lu=hoŋ, liŋkha=ŋa=bu i=ya i=ya men-jok-ma baŋniŋ:\\
and\_then bad{\sc =nmlz.nc} matter tell{\sc =seq} a\_clan{\sc =erg=hsy} what{\sc =nmlz.nc} what{\sc =nmlz.nc} {\sc neg-}do{\sc -inf[deont]} about\\
And then it said ugly things, and as for what the Linkha was not allowed to do:


\exg. purba-pʌʈi dailo me-hiŋ-ma=na,\\
east-side door {\sc neg-}turn{\sc -inf[deont]=nmlz.sg}\\
He shall not turn he door to the East.


\exg. purba-pʌʈi dailo hiŋ-ma=niŋa ucun n-leŋ-me-n.\\
east-side door turn{\sc -inf=ctmp} good {\sc neg-}become{\sc -npst[3sg]-neg}\\
It is not good when they turn the door to the East.


\exg. nhaŋ cautara=ca men-jok-m=ha=ci, bʌrpipʌl=ca men-liʔ-m=ha=ci.\\
and\_then resting\_place{\sc =add} {\sc neg-}do{\sc -inf[deont]=nmlz.nsg=nsg} banyan\_tree{\sc =add} {\sc neg-}plant{\sc -inf[deont]=nmlz.nsg=nsg}\\
And they shall neither build resting places, nor plant banyan trees.


\exg. nhaŋ yoŋ=be=ca meʔ-im-ma=ci=bu, liŋkha=ci=ga.\\
and\_then cradle{\sc =loc=add} {\sc neg-}put\_to\_sleep{\sc -inf[deont]=nsg=hsy} a\_clan{\sc =nsg=gen}\\
They shall not put them into in a bamboo cradle, too, the Linkha's (children).


\exg. hoŋkhaʔla hoŋkhaʔla leks-a=hoŋ, liŋkha=ci=ŋa ŋkha n-jog-wa-nin.\\
like\_that like\_that become{\sc -pst[3sg]=seq} a\_clan{\sc =nsg=erg} that {\sc neg-}do{\sc -npst-3pl.neg}\\
As it became like that, the Linkhas do not do that.



\exg. uŋci uhile nam=ŋa=bu u-chik ekt-u-ci=hoŋ thin, gali pi-ci=ya,  eŋ=ga ceʔya=ŋ sarab pi-ci=ya leks-a.\\
{\sc 3nsg} long\_time\_ago sun{\sc =erg=hsy} {\sc 3sg.poss-}hate hate{\sc -3.P[pst]-3nsg.P=seq} [false.start], swearword give{\sc -3nsg.P=nmlz.nsg}, {\sc 1pl.incl.poss=gen} language{\sc =ins} spell give{\sc -3nsg.P=nmlz.nsg} become{\sc -pst[3sg]}\\
Since the sun got angry at them long ago, it cursed them, it happened that it put a spell on them, in our language.



\exg. hoŋkhiŋ=maŋ loppi=ni.\\
that\_much{\sc =emph} perhaps{\sc =emph}\\
Just that much, probably.

And one thing, they say: the Linkhas shall not live on the ground floor, too, it is said; living above is good, living below is bad, on the
ground floor.

For the Linkhas, like that, that much only.
