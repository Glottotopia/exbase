\chapter{Noun-verb predicates}\label{noun-verb}

This chapter deals with idiomatic combinations of a noun and a verb. These predicates occupy a position somewhat between word and phrase. Lexically, a noun-verb predicate always constitutes one word, as its meaning is not directly predictable from its individual components (with varying degrees of metaphoricity and abstraction). But since the nouns enjoy considerable morphosyntactic freedom, speaking of  noun incorporation here would be misleading. About 80 noun-verb predicates are attested so far, with rougly two thirds referring to experiential events.

There are two main morphologically defined patterns for noun-verb predicates. In the first pattern (Simple noun-verb predicates) the predicate consists of a noun and a verb that are juxtaposed in N-V order, such as \emph{lam phakma} \rede{open way, give turn} or \emph{tukkhuʔwa lamma} \rede{doze off}  (discussed in \sectref{simple-noun-verb}).\footnote{The same pattern is also used as a strategy to incorporate Nepali nouns into the Yakkha morphology, with a very small class of light verbs, namely \emph{cokma} \rede{make}, \emph{wama} \rede{exist, be} and \emph{tokma} \rede{get}, cf. \sectref{cop}. } The second pattern (the experiencer-as-possessor construction) is semantically more restricted and also  different morphologically. It expresses experiential events, with the experiencer coded as possessor, as for instance \emph{hakamba keʔma} \rede{yawn} (lit.: (someone's) yawn to come up). This pattern is discussed in \sectref{nv-comp-poss}. 

\section{Simple noun-verb predicates}\label{simple-noun-verb}

Most of the simple noun-verb predicates are relatively transparent but fixed collocations. They denote events from the semantic domains of natural phenomena, e.g. \emph{nam phemma} \rede{shine [sun]}, \emph{taŋkhyaŋ kama} \rede{thunder} (lit. \rede{sky—call}), some culturally significant actions like \emph{kei lakma} \rede{dance the drum  dance} and also verbs that refer to experiential events and bodily functions, such as \emph{whaŋma tukma} \rede{feel hot} (literally: \rede{sweat/heat—hurt}). Experiential concepts are, however, more frequently expressed by the experiencer-as-possessor construction.\footnote{There is no clear explanation why some verbs expressing bodily functions, like  \emph{chipma chima} \rede{urinate}  belong to the simple noun-verb predicates, while most of them belong to the experiencer-as-possessor frame. Some verbs show  synonymy across these two classes, e.g., the two lexemes with the meaning  \rede{sweat}: \emph{whaŋma lomma} (literally: \rede{sweat—come out}, an experiencer-as-possessor predicate, with the experiencer coded as possessor of \emph{whaŋma}) and \emph{whaŋmaŋa lupma} (literally: \rede{sweat-	extsc{ins}—disperse}, a simple noun-verb predicate).} 

\tabref{simple-nv-tab} provides some examples of simple noun-verb predicates. Lexemes in square brackets were not found as independent words beyond their usage in these compounds. Some verbs, like weather verbs (e.g., \emph{nam phemma} \rede{shine [sun]} and \emph{wasik tama} \rede{rain}) and some experiential predicates (e.g.,  \emph{wepma sima} \rede{be thirsty} and \emph{whaŋma tukma} \rede{feel hot}), for instance, do not allow the expression of additional arguments; their valency is zero (under the assumption that the nouns belonging to the predicates are different from full-fledged arguments). If overt arguments are possible, they behave like the arguments of standard intransitive or standard transitive verbs. They trigger agreement on the verb, and they take nominative or ergative case marking (see \sectref{frames}).

The predicates vary as to whether the noun or the verb carries the semantic weight of the predicate, or whether both parts play an equal role in establishing the meaning of the construction. In verbs like  \emph{wepma sima} \rede{be thirsty} (lit. \rede{thirst—die}) or \emph{wasik tama} \rede{rain} (lit. \rede{rain—come}), the noun carries the semantic weight,\footnote{This is the reason why noun-verb collocations  have also become known as light verb constructions (after \citet{Jespersen1965_Modern}, who used this term for English collocations like \emph{have a rest}).} while in verbs like  \emph{kei lakma} \rede{drum —dance}, \emph{cabhak lakma} \rede{paddy—dance}, the nouns merely modify the verbal meaning. The nouns may stand in various thematic  relations to the verb:  in \emph{wepma sima} \rede{be thirsty}, the noun has the role of an effector, in predicates like \emph{hiʔwa phemma} \rede{wind—blow} it is closer to an agent role. In \emph{saya pokma} \rede{head-soul—raise},\footnote{\rede{Raising the head soul} is a ritual activity undertaken by specialists to help individuals whose physical or psychological well-being is in danger.} it is a patient.

There are also a few constructions in which the noun is etymologically related to the verb, such as  \emph{chipma chima} \rede{urinate}, \emph{sokma soma} \rede{breathe} and \emph{phiʔma phima} \rede{fart} (cognate object constructions). The nouns in these constructions do  not contribute to the overall meaning of the predicate.\footnote{Semantically empty nouns are also attested in the experiencer-as-possessor construction (cf. below). They are called \rede{eidemic} in \citet{Bickel1995In-the-vestibule, Bickel1997The-possessive}; and “morphanic” (morpheme orphans) in  \citet{Matisoff1986Hearts}.} 

Concerning stress assignment and the voicing rule (see \sectref{stress} and \sectref{morphophon}), noun and verb do not constitute a unit. Both the noun and the verb carry equal stress, even if the noun is monosyllabic, resulting in adjacent stress, as in \emph{ˈsak.ˈtuk.ma}. As for voicing, if the initial stop of the verbal stem is preceded by a nasal or a vowel, it remains voiceless. This stands in contrast to the verb-verb predicates (see Chapter \ref{verb-verb}), which are more tightly fused in other respects, too. Compare, for instance, \emph{cuŋ tukma} \rede{be cold} (N+V, \rede{cold—hurt}) with  \emph{ham-biʔma} \rede{distribute among people} (V+V, \rede{distribute—give}). 

There are different degrees of morphological fusion of noun and verb, and some nouns may undergo operations that are not expected if they were incorporated. They can be topicalized by means of the particle \emph{=ko} (see \Next[a]), and two nouns selecting the same light verb may also be coordinated (see \Next[b]). Such examples are rare, though. Note that \Next[a] is from a collection of proverbs and sayings, in which rhythm and rhyming constraints could lead to the insertion of particles such as \emph{=ko}. In most cases the noun and verb occur without any intervening material. The noun may also be modified independently, as the spontaneously uttered sentence in \Next[c] shows. Typically, the predicates are modified as a whole by adverbs, but here one can see that the noun may also be modified independently by adnominal modifiers. The modifying phrase is marked by a genitive, which is never found on adverbial modifiers.

\ex.\ag.makkai=ga cama, chiʔwa=ga    khyu,   cabhak=ko  lak-ma, a-ŋoʈeŋma=jyu\\
maize{\sc =gen} cooked\_grains nettle{\sc =gen} curry\_sauce paddy{\sc =top} dance{\sc -inf} {\sc 1sg.poss-}female\_in-law{\sc =hon}\\
\rede{Corn mash, nettle sauce, let us dance the paddy dance, dear sister-in-law.} \source{12\_pvb\_01.008}
\bg.kei=nuŋ cabhak lak-saŋ ucun n-joŋ-me\\
drum{\sc =com} paddy dance{\sc -sim} nice {\sc 3pl-}do{\sc -npst}\\
\rede{They have a good time, dancing the drum dance and the paddy dance.}\footnote{The interpretation of \rede{dancing the paddy dance with drums} can be ruled out here, because the drums are not played in the paddy dance.} \source{01\_leg\_07.142}
	\bg. a-phok tuk=nuŋ=ga  sak tug-a=na\\
	{\sc 1sg.poss}-stomach hurt{\sc =com=gen} hunger hurt{\sc -pst[3sg]=nmlz.sg}	\\
	\rede{I am starving.} (Lit.: \rede{A hunger struck (me) that makes my stomach ache.}) 

	
Some of the nouns may even trigger agreement on the verb, something which is also unexpected from the traditional definition of compounds, which entails that compounds are one unit lexically and thus morphologically opaque  (see e.g. \citealt{Fabb2001Compounding}). Example \Next[a] and \Next[b] are different in this respect:\footnote{Many Yakkha verbs have inchoative-stative Aktionsart so that the past inflection refers to a state that still holds true at the time of speaking.} while predicates that contain the verb \emph{tukma} \rede{hurt} are invariably inflected for third person singular (in other words, the noun \emph{whaŋma} triggers agreement; overt arguments are not possible), predicates containing \emph{sima} \rede{die}  show agreement with the overtly expressed (experiencer) subject in the unmarked nominative \Next[b].\footnote{The same argument realization is found in the Belhare cognates of these two verbs \citep{Bickel1997The-possessive}. For the details of argument realization in Yakkha see Chapter \ref{verb-val}.} Some meanings can be expressed by either frame (compare \Next[b] and \Next[c]), but this is not a regular and productive alternation.
  
\ex.\ag.whaŋma tug-a=na\\
sweat hurt{\sc [3sg]-pst=nmlz.sg}\\
\rede{I/you/he/she/it/we/they feel(s) hot.}
\bg.ka wepma sy-a-ŋ=na\\
{\sc 1sg} thirst die{\sc -pst-1sg=nmlz.sg}\\
\rede{I am thirsty.}
\bg.wepma tug-a=na\\
thirst hurt{\sc [3sg]-pst=nmlz.sg}\\
\rede{I/you/he/she/it/we/they is/are thirsty.}

Note that if \emph{wepma} in  \Last[b] were a regular verbal argument, an instrumental case would be expected, since it is an effector with respect to the verbal meaning. And indeed, some noun-verb predicates require an instrumental or an ergative case on the noun (see \Next).\footnote{Yakkha has an instrumental/ergative syncretism. Therefore, in intransitive predicates \emph{=ŋa} is interpreted as instrumental; in transitive predicates it is interpreted as ergative.} 

\ex.\ag. (chemha=ŋa) sis-a-ga=na=i?\\
		(liquor{\sc =erg}) kill{\sc -pst-2.P=nmlz.sg=q}\\
		\rede{Are you drunk?}
	\bg. sak=ŋa n-sy-a-ma-ŋa-n=na\\
			hunger{\sc =ins} {\sc neg-}die{\sc -pst-prf-1sg-neg=nmlz.sg}\\
		\rede{I am not hungry.}
	
	
Some verbs participating in noun-verb predicates have undergone semantic changes. Note that in \Last the nouns \emph{sak} and \emph{chemha} do not have the same status with regard to establishing the semantics of the whole predicate. The verbal stem \emph{sis} \rede{kill} in (a) has already acquired a metaphorical meaning  of \rede{be drunk, be intoxicated} (with the experiencer coded like a standard object). The noun is frequently omitted in natural speech, and if all arguments are overt, the experiencer precedes the stimulus, just like in Experiencer-as-Object constructions (see \Next and Chapter \ref{tr-objex}).\footnote{The same development has taken place in Belhare \citep[151]{Bickel1997The-possessive}.} In contrast to this, the stem \emph{si} in (b) is not polysemous; the noun is required to establish the meaning of the construction. 
	
\exg. ka macchi=ŋa haŋd-a-ŋ=na\\
	{\sc 1sg}	pickles/chili{\sc =erg} taste\_hot{\sc -pst-1sg.P=nmlz.sg}\\
		\rede{The pickles/chili tasted hot to me.}


Despite a certain degree of morphosyntactic freedom, the nouns are not full-fledged arguments. It is not possible to demote or promote the noun via transitivity operations such as the causative or the passive, or to extract it from the noun-verb complex via relativization (see ungrammatical \Next).
 
\ex.\ag.*lakt-i=ha cabhak\\
dance{\sc -1pl[pst]=nmlz.nsg} paddy\\
Intended: \rede{the paddy (dance) that we danced}
\bg.*tug-a=ha sak\\
hurt{\sc [3sg]-pst=nmlz.nsg} hunger\\
Intended: \rede{the hunger that was perceivable}


To sum up, simple noun-verb predicates behave like one word with respect to lexical semantics, adjacency (in the overwhelming majority of examples), extraction possibilities for the noun (i.e. the lack thereof). They behave like two words as far as clitic placement (including case), coordination, modifiability, stress and voicing are concerned. Thus, they are best understood as lexicalized phrases.


\section{Experiencer-as-possessor constructions}\label{nv-comp-poss}

Following a general tendency of languages of South and Southeast Asia, Yakkha has a dedicated construction for the expression of experiential concepts, including emotional and cognitive processes, bodily functions, but also human character traits and their moral evaluation. In Yakkha, such concepts are expressed  by predicates that are built from a noun and a verb, whereby the noun is perceived as the location of this  concept, i.e. the “arena” where a physiological or psychological experience unfolds \citep[8]{Matisoff1986Hearts}. These nouns are henceforth referred to as psych-nouns, but apart from referring to emotions and sensations, they can also refer to body parts and excreted substances. Example \Next illustrates the basic pattern:

\exg.u-niŋwa tug-a=na\\
{\sc 3sg.poss-}mind hurt{\sc [3sg]-pst=nmlz.sg}\\
\rede{He was/became sad.}


The verbs come from a rather small class;  they denote the manner in which the experiencer is affected by the event, many of which refer to motion events. The experiencer is morphologically treated like the possessor of the psych-noun; it is indexed by possessive prefixes. The expression of experiential concepts by means of a possessive metaphor is a characteristic and robust feature of Kiranti languages (cf.  the \rede{possessive of experience} in \citet{Bickel1997The-possessive}, \rede{emotive predicates} in \citet[72]{Ebert1994The-structure},  and \rede{body part emotion verbs} in \citealt[219]{Doornenbal2009A-grammar}), but this  is also found beyond Kiranti in  South-East Asian languages, including Hmong-Mien, Mon-Khmer and Tai-Kadai languages \citep{Matisoff1986Hearts, Bickel2004The-syntax}. In other Tibeto-Burman languages, such as Newari, Balti and Tibetan, for instance, experiencers are marked by a dative \citep{Beyer1992_Tibetan, Genetti2007_Newari, Read1934Balti}, an option which is not available, at least not by native morphology, in most Kiranti languages.


Experiencer-as-possessor constructions are not the only option to express experiential events. The crosslinguistic variation that can be found within experiential predicates is also reflected in the language-internal variation of Yakkha. We have seen Simple Noun-Verb predicates in \sectref{simple-noun-verb} above. Other possibilities are simple verbal stems like \emph{haŋma} \rede{taste hot/have a spicy sensation} (treating the experiencer like a standard P argument), \emph{eʔma} \rede{perceive, like, have an impression, have opinion} (treating it like a standard A argument) and the  historically complex  verb \emph{kisiʔma} \rede{be afraid} (treating it like a standard S argument). Verbs composed of several verbal stems may also encode experiential notions, such as \emph{yoŋdiʔma} \rede{be scared} (shake-give). It is the  possessive experiencer verbs though that constitute the biggest class of experiential predicates. About  fifty verbs have been found so far (cf. Tables \ref{tab-exp1} and \ref{tab-exp2}), but probably this list is far from exhaustive. 

This section is organized as follows:  the various possibilities of argument realization within the experiencer-as-possessor frame are introduced in \sectref{poss-e1} introduces, \sectref{poss-e3} looks at the principles behind the semantic composition of possessive experiential predicates, and \sectref{poss-e2} deals with the morphosyntax of these predicates and with the behavioral properties of experiencers as non-canonically marked S or A arguments. 


\subsection{Subframes of argument realization}\label{poss-e1}

A basic distinction can be drawn between predicates of intransitive valency and transitive or labile\footnote{See also \sectref{labile}.} valency (see Tables \ref{tab-exp1} and  \ref{tab-exp2} at the end of the section). Within this  basic distinction, the verbs can be further divided into various subframes of argument realization. In all classes, the experiencer is marked as possessor of the psych-noun, i.e., as possessor of a sensation or an affected body part.

In the class of intransitive verbs, the psych-noun triggers third person marking on the verb, as in \Last and \Next. Intransitive verbs usually do not have an overt noun phrase referring to the experiencer; only the possessive prefix identifies the reference of the experiencer. When the experiencer has a special pragmatic status, and is thus marked by a discourse particle, it can be overtly expressed  in eitherthe nominative or in the genitive (compare example \ref{kacaayupma} and \ref{ukkaseopomma} below). As this is quite rare, the reasons for this alternation are not clear yet.

In some cases, the noun is conceptualized as nonsingular, triggering  the according  number markers on the verb as well (see \Next[a]). One verb in this group is special in consisting of  two nouns and a verb. Both nouns take the possessive prefix (see \Next[b]). Their respective full forms would be \emph{niŋwa} and \emph{lawa}. It is not uncommon that the nouns get reduced to one syllable in noun-verb predicates.

\ex.\ag.a-pomma=ci ŋ-gy-a=ha=ci\\
{\sc 1sg.poss-}laziness{\sc =nsg} {\sc 3pl-}come\_up{\sc -pst=nmlz.nsg=nsg}\\
\rede{I feel lazy.}
\bg.a-niŋ a-la sy-a=na\\
{\sc 1sg.poss-}mind {\sc 1sg.poss-}spirit die{\sc [3sg]-pst=nmlz.sg}\\
\rede{I am fed up/annoyed.}



The transitive group can be divided into five classes (cf. \tabref{tab-exp2} on page \pageref{tab-exp2}). In all classes, the experiencer is coded as the possessor of the psych-noun (via possessive prefixes), and hence this does not need to be explicitly stated in the schematic representation of argument realization in the table. 

In Class (a) the experiencer is realized like a standard transitive subject (in addition to being indexed by possessive prefixes): it  triggers transitive subject agreement and has ergative case marking (only overtly marked if it has third person reference and is overt, which is rare). The stimulus is unmarked and triggers object agreement (see \Next[a]). 

Class (b) differs from class (a) in that the psych-noun triggers object agreement, invariably third person and in some cases, third person plural (see \Next[b]). No stimulus is expressed in class (b). This class has the highest number of members. 

 \ex.\ag. uŋ=ŋa   u-ppa             u-luŋma  tukt-uks-u=na\\
{\sc 3sg=erg} {\sc 3sg.poss-}father {\sc 3sg.poss-}liver pour{\sc -prf-3.P=nmlz.sg}\\
\rede{He loved his father.} (lit.: \rede{He poured his father his liver.})
\bg.\label{ex-yupmaci}a-yupma=ci cips-u-ŋ-ci-ŋ=ha\\
 {\sc 1sg.poss-}sleepiness{\sc =nsg} complete{\sc -3.P[pst]-1sg.A-3nsg.P-1sg.A=nmlz.nsg}\\
\rede{I am well-rested.} (lit.: \rede{I completed my sleep(s).})

Predicates of class (c) show three possibilities of argument realization. One possibility is an unexpected pattern where the stimulus triggers object agreement, while the psych-noun triggers subject agreement, which leads, oddly enough, to  a literal translation \rede{my disgust brings up bee larvae} in \Next[a]. Despite the subject agreement on the verb, the  psych-nouns in this class do not host an ergative case marker,  an option that is available, however, for verbs of class (d). The experiencer is indexed only  by the possessive prefix in this frame; overt experiencer arguments were not found. The stimulus can be in the nominative or in the ablative in class (c), but if it is in the ablative, the verb is blocked from showing object agreement with the stimulus, showing 3>3 agreement instead (see \Next[b]). The third option of argument realization in class (c) is identical to class (a) (cf. the comments in \Next[a] and (b)). Reasons or conditions for these alternations, for instance  in different  configurations of the referential properties of the arguments, could not be detected. 

\ex.\ag.thaŋsu=ga u-chya=ci a-chippa ket-wa-ci=ha\\
bee{\sc =gen} {\sc 3sg.poss-}child{\sc =nsg} {\sc 1sg.poss-}disgust bring\_up{\sc -npst-3nsgP=nmlz.nsg}\\
\rede{I am disgusted by the bee larvae.} \\
(same: \emph{thaŋsuga ucyaci achippa ketwaŋciŋha} - (1{\sc sg}>3{\sc pl}, class (a)))
\bg.njiŋda=bhaŋ a-sokma hips-wa=na!\\
{\sc 2du=abl} {\sc 1sg.poss-}breath whip-{\sc npst[3A>3.P]=nmlz.sg}\\
\rede{I get fed up by you.} \\
(same: \emph{njiŋda asokma himmeʔnencinhaǃ} - 1{\sc sg}>2{\sc du}, class (a))


In class (d), the psych-noun also triggers transitive subject agreement, and it exhibits ergative marking. The object agreement slot can be filled either by  the stimulus  or by the experiencer argument (see \Next[a]).\footnote{There are (at least) two concepts, \emph{saya} and \emph{lawa}, that are related to or similar to \rede{soul} in Yakkha and the Kiranti metaphysical world in general.  \citet{Gaenszle2000Origins} writes about these two (and other) concepts in Mewahang (also Eastern Kiranti, Upper Arun branch): 

\begin{quote}
The concept of \emph{saya} is understood to be a kind of “vital force" that must be continually renewed (literally: “bought") by means of various sacrificial rites. [...] The vital force \emph{saya} makes itself felt [...] not only in subjective physical or psychic states but also, and in particular, in the social, economic, religious and political spheres - that is, it finds expression in success, wealth, prestige and power. The third concept, \emph{lawa} (cf. \citet[165]{Hardman1981The-psychology}, \citealt[299]{Hardman_phd_Conformity}) is rendered by the Nepali word \emph{sāto} (\rede{soul}). This is a small, potentially evanescent substance, which is compared to a mosquito, a butterfly or a bee, and which, if it leaves the body for a longer period, results in loss of consciousness and mental illness. The shaman must then undertake to summon it back or retrieve it. \citep[119]{Gaenszle2000Origins} 
\end{quote}
}

Class (e) is exemplified by \Next[b]. Here, the experiencer is the possessor of a body part  which triggers object agreement on the verb. Some verbs may express an effector or stimulus overtly. Others, like \emph{ya limma} \rede{taste sweet} cannot express an overt A argument, despite being inflected transitively (see \Next[c]). This pattern is reminiscent of the transimpersonal verbs (treated in \sectref{tr-imp}).

 \ex.\ag.\label{ex-lawa}a-lawa=ŋa naʔ-ya-ŋ=na\\
 {\sc 1sg.poss-}spirit{\sc =erg} leave{\sc -V2.leave-pst-1sg.P=nmlz.sg}\\
 \rede{I was frozen in shock.} (lit.: \rede{My spirit left me.})
 \bg. (cuŋ=ŋa) a-muk=ci khokt-u-ci=ha\\
 (cold{\sc =erg}) {\sc 1sg.poss-}hand{\sc =nsg} chop{\sc -3.P[pst]-3nsg.P=nmlz.nsg}\\
\rede{My hands are tingling/freezing (from the cold).} (lit.: \rede{The cold chopped off my hands.})
\bg.a-ya limd-u=na\\
{\sc 1sg.poss-}mouth taste\_sweet{\sc -3.P[pst]=nmlz.sg}\\
\rede{It tastes sweet to me.}

Many of the transitive verbs are attested also with intransitive inflection without further morphological marker of decreased transitivity, i.e. they show a lability alternation (see \Next).

 \ex.\ag.n-lok  khot-a-ŋ-ga=na=i?\\
	{\sc 2sg.poss}-anger scratch{\sc -pst-1sg.P-2.A=nmlz.sg=q}	\\
	\rede{Are you angry at me?}
\bg.  o-lok khot-a=na\\
{\sc 3sg.poss-}anger scratch{\sc [3sg]-pst=nmlz.sg}\\
\rede{He/she got angry.}


For two verbs, namely \emph{nabhuk-lemnhaŋma} \rede{dishonor (self/others)} (lit.: \rede{throw away one's nose}) and \emph{nabhuk-yuŋma} \rede{uphold moral} (lit.: \rede{keep one's nose}), there is one more constellation of participants, due to their particular semantics. The experiencer can either be identical to the agent or different from it, as the social consequences of morally transgressive behavior usually affect more people than just the agent (e.g. illegitimate sexual contacts, or an excessive use of swearwords).\footnote{This concept is particularly related to immoral behavior of women. It is rarely, if ever, heard that a man \rede{threw away his nose}.} The morphosyntactic consequences of this are that the verbal agreement and the possessive prefix on the noun may either have the same conominal or two different conominals. Taken literally, one may \rede{throw away one's own nose} or \rede{throw away somebody else's nose} (see \Next). Note that due to the possessive argument realization it is possible to have partial coreference, which is impossible in the standard transitive verbal inflection (cf. \sectref{verb-infl}).


\ex. \ag. u-nabhuk lept-haks-u=na\\
{\sc 3sg.poss-}nose throw{\sc -V2.send-3.P[pst]=nmlz.sg}\\
\rede{She dishonored herself.}

In \sectref{simple-noun-verb} cognate object constructions like \emph{chipma chima} \rede{urinate} were discussed. In these cases, the noun is cognate to the verb and does not actually make a semantic contribution to the predicate. Such developments are also found in the experiencer-as-possessor frame. Example \Next[a] and \Next[b] are two alternative ways to express the same propositional content. Note the change of person marking to third person in (b). The noun \emph{phok} \rede{belly} is, of course, not etymologically related to the verb in this case, but it also does not make a semantic contribution. Further examples are \emph{ya limma} \rede{mouth-taste sweet} and \emph{hi ema} \rede{stool-defecate}.

\subsection{Semantic properties}\label{poss-e3}

The experiencer-as-possessor predicates are far less transparent and predictable than the simple noun-verb predicates. The nouns participating in this structure refer to abstract psychological or moral concepts like \emph{lok} \rede{anger}, \emph{yupma} \rede{sleepiness} and \emph{pomma} \rede{laziness}, or they refer to body parts or inner organs which are exploited for experiential metaphors. The lexeme \emph{luŋma} \rede{liver}, for instance, is used in the expression of love and greed, and \emph{nabhuk} \rede{nose} is connected to upholding (or eroding) moral standards. The human body is a very common source for psychological metaphors, or as  Matisoff observed: 

\begin{quote}
[...] it is a universal of human metaphorical thinking to equate mental operations and states with bodily sensations and movements, as well as with physical qualities and events in the outside world. \citep[9]{Matisoff1986Hearts} 
\end{quote} 

In Yakkha, too, psychological concepts are treated as concrete tangible entities that can be possessed, moved or otherwise manipulated. Many verbs employed in experiencer-as-possessor predicates are verbs of motion and caused motion, like \emph{keʔma} (both \rede{come up} and \rede{bring up}, distinguished by different stem behavior), \emph{kaŋma} \rede{fall}, \emph{haŋma} \rede{send}, \emph{lemnhaŋma} \rede{throw}, \emph{pokma} \rede{raise} or \emph{lomma} (both  \rede{take out} and \rede{come out}). Other verbs refer to physical change (both spontaneous and caused), such as \emph{khoŋdiʔma} \rede{break down}, \emph{himma} \rede{whip/flog} or \emph{kipma} \rede{cover tightly}. Most of the predicates acquire their experiential semantics only in the particular idiomatic combinations. Only a few verbs have intrinsic experiential semantics, like \emph{tukma} \rede{hurt/be ill}.


\subsection{Morphosyntactic properties}\label{poss-e2}

\subsubsection{Wordhood vs. phrasehood}

Experiencer-as-possessor predicates host both nominal and verbal morphology. A possessive prefix (referring to the experiencer) attaches to the noun, and the verbal inflection attaches to the verb. The verbal inflection always attaches to the verbal stem, so that the verbal prefixes stand between the noun and the verb (see \Next). It has been shown above that some of the  psych-nouns can  be inflected for number as well as trigger plural morphology on the verb, and that others may show case marking (see \ref{ex-yupmaci} and \ref{ex-lawa}).

\exg. a-luŋma n-duŋ-meʔ-nen=na\\
		{\sc 1sg.poss}-liver {\sc neg-}pour{\sc -npst-1>2=nmlz.sg}\\
	\rede{I do not love you./I do not have compassion for you.}


The experiencer argument, which is always indexed by the possessive prefix on the noun, is rarely expressed overtly. It may show the following properties: it is in the nominative or in the genitive when the light verb is intransitive, and in the ergative in predicates that show transitive subject agreement with the experiencer argument (class (a) and (b)). 

Noun and verb have to be adjacent, as shown by the following examples. Constituents like degree adverbs and quantifiers  (see \Next[a] and \Next[b]) or question words (see \Next[c]) may not intervene. 

\ex.\ag. tuknuŋ u-niŋwa (*tuknuŋ) tug-a-ma, [...]\\
 completely {\sc 3sg.poss}-mind  (*completely) hurt{\sc [3sg]-pst-prf}\\
 \rede{She was so sad, ...} \source{38\_nrr\_07.009}
 \bg. ka khiŋ pyak a-ma=ŋa u-luŋma  (*khiŋ pyak) tuŋ-me-ŋ=na\\
 {\sc 1sg} so\_much much {\sc 1sg.poss-}mother{\sc =erg} {\sc 3sg.poss-}liver (*so\_much much) pour{\sc [ 3sg.A]-npst-1sg.P=nmlz.sg}\\
 \rede{How much my mother loves me!}\source{01\_leg\_07.079}
 \bg. ijaŋ n-lok (*ijaŋ) khot-a-ŋ-ga=na=i?\\
 why	{\sc 2sg.poss}-anger (*why) scratch{\sc -pst-1sg.P-2sg.A=nmlz.sg=q}\\
 \rede{Why are you angry at me?}


Information-structural clitics, usually attaching to the rightmost element of the phrase, may generally stand between noun and verb, 
but some combinations were judged better than others (compare \Next[a] with \Next[b]). Compare also the impossible additive focus particle \emph{=ca} in \Next[a] with the restrictive focus particle \emph{=se} and the contrastive particle \emph{=le} in \NNext. Overtly expressed experiencer arguments  may naturally also host topic and focus particles, just like any other constituent can. This is shown e.g. by \Next[b] and by \NNext[c] and (d).

%*** \Next[a] how then?? kaca ayupmaci ....? -yes

\rede{Only he was lazy (not the others).}


The noun can even be omitted, in case it was already active in discourse, such as in the question-answer pair in \Next. It is, however, not possible to extract the noun from the predicate to relativize on it, neither with the nominalizer \emph{-khuba} nor with the  nominalizers \emph{=na} and \emph{=ha} as shown in \NNext (cf. Chapter \ref{ch-nmlz}).  Furthermore, in my corpus there is not a single example of a noun in a possessive experiential construction that is modified independently. The predicate is always modified as a whole, by adverbial modification. A certain degree of  morphological freedom does not imply that the noun is a full-fledged argument.


 	\ex.\ag. ŋkha mamu=ci n-sap thakt-u-ci-g=ha=i?\\
	those girl{\sc =nsg} {\sc 2sg.poss-[stem]} send\_up-{\sc 3.P[pst]-3nsg.P-2.A=nmlz.nsg=q}\\
	\rede{Do you like those girls?}
	\bg. thakt-u-ŋ-ci-ŋ=ha!\\
	send\_up-{\sc 3.P[pst]-1sg.A-3nsg.P-1sg.A=nmlz.nsg}\\
	\rede{I do!} 

	\ex.\ag.*kek-khuba (o-)pomma\\
	come\_up-{\sc nmlz[S/A]} ({\sc 3sg.poss-})laziness\\
	Intended: \rede{the laziness that comes up}
	\bg.*ky-a=na (o-)pomma\\
	come\_up{\sc -pst=nmlz.sg} ({\sc 3sg.poss-})laziness\\
	Intended: \rede{the laziness that came up}

	
The noun-verb complex as a whole may serve as input to derivational processes, such as the creation of adjectives by means of a reduplication and the nominalizer \emph{=na} or \emph{=ha}, shown in \Next. 

\ex.\ag.uŋ tuknuŋ    luŋma-tuk-tuk=na       sa-ya-ma\\
{\sc 3sg} completely liver-{\sc redupl-}pour{\sc =nmlz.sg}  be{\sc [3]-pst-prf}\\
\rede{She was such a kind (loving, caring) person.}\source{01\_leg\_07.061}

\rede{What a disgusting spider!}
\bg.nna chik-ʔek-ʔek=na  babu\\
that hate-{\sc redupl-}make\_break{\sc =nmlz.sg} boy\\
\rede{that outrageous boy}


Wrapping up, just as we have seen above for the simple noun-verb predicates, the noun and the verb build an inseparable unit for some processes, but not for others; the predicates show both word-like and phrasal properties. Semantically, of course, noun and verb build one unit, but  they can be targeted by certain morphological and syntactic processes: the nonsingular marking on psych-nouns, psych-nouns triggering agreement, the possibility of hosting phrasal clitics, and the partial ellipsis. The ambiguous status of these predicates is also reflected in their phonology: noun and verb are two units with respect to stress and voicing.  

Another feature distinguishes the possessive experiencer predicates from compounds: nouns in compounds are typically generic (\citealt[66]{Fabb2001Compounding}, \citealt[156]{Haspelmath2002Understanding}). As the noun in the possessive experiential predicates hosts the possessive prefix, its reference is made specific. The contiguity of noun and verb, the derivation of adjectives and the restrictions on extraction and modification also clearly show that noun and verb are one unit. All these conflicting properties of Yakkha add further support to approaches that question the notion of the word as opaque to morphosyntactic processes (as e.g. stated in the Lexical Integrity Principle). The possessive experiential predicates may best be understood as lexicalized phrases, such as  the predicates discussed in \sectref{simple-noun-verb} above.  


\subsubsection{Behavioral properties of the experiencer arguments}\label{poss-e4}

Experiencers as morphologically downgraded, non-canonically marked subjects do not necessarily have to be downgraded in other parts of the grammar. As observed  by \citet{Bickel2004The-syntax}, Tibeto-Burman languages, in contrast to Indo-Aryan languages, show a strong tendency to treat  experiencers as full-fledged arguments  syntactically. Yakkha confirms this generalization. In syntactic constructions that select pivots, the experiencer argument is chosen, regardless of the fact that  it is often blocked from triggering verbal agreement. The nominalizer \emph{-khuba} (S/A arguments) selects the experiencer, because it is the most agent-like argument in the clause (see \Next). As the ungrammatical \Next[c] shows, the stimulus cannot be nominalized by \emph{-khuba}.

%***checked this from notes 2011: chippa kekkhuba camyoŋba not possibleǃǃ ( rather chippakekeʔna?), hangkhuba machi, *hangkhuba mamu (from KS, MM judged this as ungrammatical)

 \ex.\ag.takabaŋ u-chippa kek-khuba mamu\\
spider {\sc 3sg.poss-}disgust come\_up{\sc -nmlz} girl\\
\rede{the girl who is disgusted by spiders}
\bg.o-pomma kek-khuba babu\\
{\sc 3sg.poss-}laziness come\_up{\sc -nmlz} boy\\
\rede{the lazy fellow}
\bg.*chippa kek-khuba camyoŋba \\
disgust come\_up{\sc -nmlz} food \\
Intended: \rede{disgusting food} (only: \emph{chippakekeʔna})

Another process that exclusively selects S and A arguments is the converbal clause linkage, which is marked by the suffix \emph{-saŋ}. It implies that two (or more) events happen  simultaneously, and it requires the referential identity of the S and A arguments in both clauses. Example \Next illustrates that this also holds for experiencer arguments.

\ex.\ag. o-pomma kes-saŋ kes-saŋ kam cog-wa\\
{\sc 3sg.poss-}laziness come\_up{\sc -sim} come\_up{\sc -sim} work do{\sc -npst[3.P]}\\
\rede{He does the work lazily.}
\bg.uŋ lok khos-saŋ lukt-a-khy-a=na\\
{\sc 3sg} anger scratch{\sc -sim} run{\sc [3sg]-pst-V2.go-pst=nmlz.sg}\\
\rede{He ran away angrily.}
 

In causatives, the experiencer is the causee, as is evidenced by the verbal marking in  \Next. There  is no overt marking for 1.P, but the reference is retrieved from the opposition to the other forms in the paradigm — with third person object agreement, the inflected form would have to be \emph{himmetugha}.

\exg. khem=nuŋ manoj=ŋa a-sokma him-met-a-g=haǃ\\
Khem{\sc =com} Manoj{\sc =erg} {\sc 1sg.poss-}breath whip{\sc -caus-pst-2.A[1.P]=nmlz.nsg}\\
\rede{Khem and Manoj (you) annoy me!}


The last syntactic property discussed here is the agreement in complement-taking verbs that embed infinitives, as for instance \emph{yama} \rede{be able} or \emph{tarokma} \rede{begin}, shown in \Next. Basically, the complement-taking verb mirrors the agreement that is found in the embedded verb. Those predicates whose experiencer arguments do not trigger agreement in the verb  do not show agreement in the complement-taking verb either. Other restrictions  are semantic in nature, so that, for instance, \rede{I want to get lazy} is not possible, because being lazy is not conceptualized as something one can do on purpose. Thus, the agreement facts neither confirm nor contradict the generalization made above. A more interesting case is the periphrastic progressive construction, with the lexical verb in the infinitive and an intransitively inflected auxiliary \emph{-siʔ} (infinitial form and auxiliary got fused into one word). The auxiliary selects the experiencer as agreement triggering argument (see \Next[b]).


\ex.\ag.ka nda a-luŋma tuk-ma n-ya-meʔ-nen=na\\
{\sc 1sg[erg]} {\sc 2sg} {\sc 1sg.poss-}liver pour{\sc -inf} {\sc neg-}be\_able-{\sc npst-1>2=nmlz.sg}\\
\rede{I cannot love you./I cannot have pity for you.}
\bg.nda ka ijaŋ n-lok khoʔ-ma-si-me-ka=na?\\
 {\sc 2sg[erg]} {\sc 1sg} why {\sc 2sg.poss-}anger scratch{\sc -inf-aux.prog-npst-2=nmlz.sg}\\
\rede{Why are you being angry at me?}
