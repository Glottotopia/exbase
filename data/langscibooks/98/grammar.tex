\section{Introduction}


Although the bulk of this book is dedicated to the Icétôd-English dictionary and English-Icétôd reversal index, the following section offers an overview sketch of Icétôd grammar. The sketch covers most important features of the grammatical system but only to a shallow depth. Those who wish to dig deeper are encouraged to consult the fuller treatment published as \textit{A grammar of Icé-tód: Northeast Uganda’s last thriving Kuliak language} \citep{Schrock2014}, which is freely available for download from several websites on the internet. 

Linguistic concepts are most easily defined with linguistic terminology. Thus, due to limitations of time and space, this sketch of Icétôd grammar is geared in style toward the general linguist. That said, an aim has been to clearly define some of the key terms used and to describe the grammatical structures in simple, clear language. Unfortunately, some of the discussion may remain opaque to any non-linguist readers. For this, I offer my sincere apologies. I am very willing to clarify or explain in layman’s terms any point raised in this grammar sketch. Feel free to contact me at: \href{mailto:betsoniik@gmail.com}{betsoniik@gmail.com}.

The grammar sketch begins with a description of the language’s sound system (phonology) and then proceeds to words and word-building strategies (morphology). It ends with a very shallow dip into syntax. Because of its length, technical discussion, and many sections and subsections, the sketch is probably most useful as a reference tool. However, should the reader (especially the language-learner) have time, it may prove beneficial to read the sketch from front to back. Doing so would provide a bird’s-eye view of the whole system.

Learning any language from printed sources alone is rarely ideal. Ideally, every learner would have the chance to soak up language naturally as children do. Sadly, most adult learners do not have that luxury. I recommend mixing approaches to suit one’s personality, learning style, schedule, and responsibilities. Studying grammar from a book like this one will not appeal to everyone, yet all learners will occasionally get stuck on points of grammar during the course of their learning. Just as the foregoing dictionary can help you fill in gaps where specific words need to be, this grammar sketch can help fill in holes in your understanding of how Icétôd works. If it should succeed at all in that regard, all my efforts will have been proven worthwhile.
