\chapter{Derivational morphology}\label{derivMorph}\is{derivation}
\PS\ is rich in derivational morphology. While it is beyond the scope of the present work to provide a thorough description of all the various derivational processes and of their semantic nuances and productivity\is{productivity},\footnote{Israel Ruong (himself a native speaker of \PS) dedicated his entire PhD thesis to verbal derivation in \PS\ \citep{Ruong1943}.} %: \It{Lappische Verbalableitung dargestellt auf Grundlage des Pitelappischen} ‘Saami Verbal Derivation as illustrated by the \PS\ language’ (my translation).} 
the following should provide a general impression of how derivational morphology works in \PS, as well as an overview of some of the more common derivational morphemes attested in the corpus and extant in the wordlist compiled by the \WLP\ (cf.~\SEC\ref{orthography}). 

In the following, derivational meanings are assigned to suffixes for simplicity in classification; however, as with inflectional\is{inflection} suffixes, derivational suffixes coincide with non-linear morphology\is{morphology!non-linear} when the derivational base is subject to non-linear morphological alternations. %As can be expected cross-linguistically, derivational suffixes occur before inflectional
%It goes without saying that only open word classes (nouns (but not the closed nominal sub-category of pronouns), verbs, adjectives and adverbs) can be derived. 
There are many nominalizing and verbalizing derivational processes, and derivations can apply to already derived forms. 
%It is not always possible to unambiguously determine the base that a derived lexeme is based on. 
On the other hand, there are only two adjectivizers and one adverbializer. 

Nominal derivation and verbal derivation are especially complex because the semantics of a derived word do not consistently equal the sum of the meanings of its components. Furthermore, the borderline between polysemy and homonymy of suffixes cannot always be clearly determined, and the decision whether two formally identical, but semantically different forms should be ascribed to the same morpheme or to distinct morphemes is not always obvious. 
This is reflected in the glossing standards used here in which most nominalizers and verbalizers are simply allotted numbers, as in \Sc{nmlz1} or \Sc{vblz3}, as opposed to more meaningful glosses such as \Sc{dim}. 

In the following, nominal derivation is dealt with first, in \SEC\ref{nDerivation}, before moving on to verbal derivation %(including passives) 
in \SEC\ref{vDerivation}, while adjectival and adverbial derivation are described briefly in \SEC\ref{adjDerivation} and \SEC\ref{advDerivation}, respectively. The final section (\SEC\ref{derivMorphSummary}) provides a summary of the derivational morphemes discussed here. 

Note that examples in the present chapter include references to either the documentation corpus or an entry in the database from the \WLP\ (cf.~\SEC\ref{orthography}). Nearly all references to the documentation corpus are for elicitation sessions, and these are marked accordingly. Unlike examples in the other chapters, in which references indicate a particular utterance of a recording, references here may not be not more specific than the recording name alone because the relevant data were obtained during the course of a longer discussion, and not just in a single utterance. References referring to the \WLP’s database consist only of the four-digit entry number.  


\section{Nominal derivation}\label{nDerivation}\is{derivation!nominal|(}
Nouns can be derived from verbs, adjectives, or other nouns. Some of the more common derivational suffixes are \It{-tj}, \It{-k}, \It{-o}, \It{-däddje}, \It{-vuohta}, and these are discussed in the following sections. The bases they can be applied to are summarized in Table~\vref{NMLZtable}.

\subsection{The diminutive suffix \It{-tj}}\label{dim}\is{diminutive}\is{derivation!nominal}
The diminutive suffix \It{-tj} (glossed as \Sc{dim}) can be affixed to a nominal base to form a denominal noun with a diminutive meaning. Examples can be found in \REF{DIMex1} through \REF{DIMex6}.

The diminutive form features the same stem found in the \NOMs.\PLs\ form of a noun paradigm (differences in the segments occurring between the consonant center and the right edge of the nominal base in these examples are due to regular alternations in inflectional noun class suffixes on the base). %and are not indicated in the morphological structure or in the glosses in order to keep the glosses from getting overly complicated. 
The resulting diminutive nouns are class IIIa nouns; a nearly complete paradigm for the derived noun \It{guolátj} ‘little fish’ is provided in Table~\ref{fishDIMparadigm} in \SEC\ref{NclassIII}. % in the chapter on nouns. 
Note also that there is a diminutive verbalizer suffix \It{-tj}; cf.~\SEC\ref{verbDIM}. 


\subsection{The general nominalizer suffix \It{-k}}\label{nmlz2}\is{derivation!nominal}
The nominalizer suffix \It{-k} (spelled \It{-g-} intervocalically; glossed as \Sc{nmlz}\footnote{Due to its frequency and extensive use as a general nominalizer, the nominalizer \It{-k} is glossed simply as \Sc{nmlz} without any additional number to specify it, unlike the other, less frequent nominalizers described in \SEC\ref{nmlz1} through \SEC\ref{vuohta}.}) 
can be affixed to a noun\is{noun}, a verb\is{verb} or an adjective\is{adjective}. The resulting derived nouns have a wide variety of meanings, but generally have a referent which is someone or something with a property referred to by the base. %, but in general refers to a person or thing somehow related to the base for derivation. 
A number of examples are provided in \REF{NMLZ2ex1} through \REF{NMLZ2ex9} below, but this is hardly an exhaustive sample. %generally indicates ?. 

In \REF{NMLZ2ex1} the derived noun \It{guhkajuolgagijd} ‘long-legger-\Sc{acc.pl}’ is based on a compound noun \It{guhka-juällge} ‘long-leg’, and is used several times in the corpus to refer to moose. 
\ea\label{NMLZ2ex1}
\glll	vuojdne edna guhkajuolgagijd?\\
	vuojdne edna guhka-juolga-g-ijd\\

\Transl{Did you see some moose?}{}	\Corpus{080924}{007}
\z
The derivation of the base compound’s head \It{guhka-juällge} ‘long-leg’ into the derived form is illustrated in \REF{NMLZ2ex2}.

\z

Two other examples of denominal nouns derived with \It{-k} are the word \It{jagak} ‘yearling, one-year-old’, which is derived from the nominal base \It{jahke} ‘year’, as given in \REF{NMLZ2ex3a}, and the word \It{nástak} ‘police’, which is derived from the nominal base \It{násste} ‘star’: %, as shown in \REF{NMLZ2ex3c}. 
\ea\label{NMLZ2ex3a}

\DerivExamWL{násste}{star\BS\Sc{nom.sg}}{násta-k}{star-\Sc{nmlz}\BS\Sc{nom.sg}}{police, police officer}{1249}
\z

The word \It{máhtak} ‘knowledgable person’ is derived from the verb \mbox{\It{máhttet}} ‘can’: %, as shown in \REF{NMLZ2ex3b}. 
\ea\label{NMLZ2ex3b}
\DerivExamWL{máhtte-t}{can-\Sc{inf}}{máhta-k}{can-\Sc{nmlz}\BS\Sc{nom.sg}}{knowledgable person}{1110}
\z

The word \It{villguk} ‘white reindeer’ is based on a form \It{vällg-} ‘white’ (cf.\,the attributive adjective \It{villgis} and predicative adjective \It{vällgat} ‘white’): %, as shown in \REF{NMLZ2ex4}. %\marginpar{this maybe needs re-writing - what is the base for derivation?} 
\ea\label{NMLZ2ex4}
\DerivExamWL{vällg-}{white}{villgu-k}{white-\Sc{nmlz}\BS\Sc{nom.sg}}{white reindeer}{2219}
\z
%It is likely the case that the stem \It{villg-} never occurs without some ending, such as \It{-s} in the attributive adjective form and \It{-t} in the predicative adjective form. %In this case, the nominalizer \It{-k} seems to trigger the weak consonant gradation allomorph \It{vilg-}.

Similarly, the word \It{suojmek} ‘slow person’ is derived from the stem \It{suajbm-} ‘slow’ (cf.~the attributive adjective \It{suojmas} and the predicative adjective \mbox{\It{suajbma}} ‘slow’): %, as shown in \REF{NMLZ2ex5}. 
\ea\label{NMLZ2ex5}
\DerivExamWL{suajbm-}{slow}{suojmek}{slow-\Sc{nmlz}\BS\Sc{nom.sg}}{slow person}{2650}
\z

The word \It{vidak} ‘five-crown coin’ is derived from the numeral base \It{vihta} ‘five’, while \It{vidalågåk} ‘fifty-crown bank note’ is derived from the numeral base \It{vidalåhkå} ‘fifty’: %These are summarized in \REF{NMLZ2ex6} and \REF{NMLZ2ex7}. 
\ea\label{NMLZ2ex6}
\DerivExamWL{vihta}{five}{vida-k}{five-\Sc{nmlz}\BS\Sc{nom.sg}}{five-crown coin}{4051}

\ea\label{NMLZ2ex7}
\DerivExamWL{vidalåhkå}{fifty}{vidalågå-k}{fifty-\Sc{nmlz}\BS\Sc{nom.sg}}{fifty-crown banknote}{4053}
\z

There are still other cases of nouns derived by \It{-k} which are based on a verb form at the deepest level, but feature subsequent derivational affixes between the root lexeme and the final nominalizing suffix\is{suffix!derivational} \It{-k}, so that it is not clear what base lexeme \It{-k} is directly attached to. For instance, the noun \It{gaskaldak} ‘bite, bit’ is ultimately based on the verb \It{gassket} ‘bite’, but it is not clear what the derivational affix or affixes expressed by the segments \It{-alda-} could indicate: %. This is illustrated in \REF{NMLZ2ex8}. 
\ea\label{NMLZ2ex8}
\DerivExamWL{gasske-t}{bite-\Sc{inf}}{gask-alda-k}{bite-\Sc{vblz}?-\Sc{nmlz}\BS\Sc{nom.sg}}{bite, bit}{3278}
\z

Finally, several place names are also likely derived using \It{-k}. For instance, the name \It{Tjårvek} ‘Lake Hornavan’\footnote{\It{Tjårvek} is the large lake on which Arjeplog, the main \PS\ community, is located. Even the Swedish\is{language contact} name \It{Hornavan} seems to refer to antlers or horns (cf.~Swedish \It{horn} ‘horn’) and could be the result of a loan\is{language contact} translation.} 
is derived from the nominal base \It{tjårrve} ‘horn, antler’: %, as summarized in \REF{NMLZ2ex9}. 
\ea\label{NMLZ2ex9}
\DerivExam{tjårrve}{antler\BS\Sc{nom.sg}}{tjårve-k}{antler-\Sc{nmlz}\BS\Sc{nom.sg}}{Lake Hornavan}{110517b2}{083}
\z

It is clear that, morphophonologically, the suffix \It{-k} triggers the weak consonant grade, when applicable. The vowel immediately preceding the suffix \It{-k} is not consistent; this could be due to various noun class bases, or perhaps there are in fact more than one nominalizing suffixes of the form \It{-Vk}. These questions as well as other questions concerning the variety of uses of this very flexible and common derivational morpheme must be left for future study. 
%Future research could shed light on the variety of uses for the very flexible derivational morpheme \It{-k}. 



\subsection{The action nominalizer suffix \It{-o}}\label{nmlz1}\is{derivation!nominal}
The nominalizer suffix \It{-o} (glossed as \Sc{nmlz1}) can be affixed to a verbal base to form a deverbal noun. %
In general, the resulting noun refers to the action or the result of the action denoted by the stem, as in \REF{NMLZ1ex1} through \REF{NMLZ1ex7}. 
\ea\label{NMLZ1ex1}

\DerivExamWL{dårrjo-t}{support-\Sc{inf}}{dårrj-o}{support-\Sc{nmlz1}\BS\Sc{nom.sg}}{support}{4732}
\z
However, as \REF{NMLZ1ex2} and \REF{NMLZ1ex3a} indicate, the deverbalized noun does not have to refer exactly to the action or result of the verb, but only to a related concept. 
\ea\label{NMLZ1ex2}

Such nouns are in nominal inflectional class Ic; these examples present the nominal singular forms, and are thus in the strong stage of consonant gradation. 
%In these examples, the deverbal noun is in the strong stage of consonant gradation, and belongs to the %\marginpar{confirm Ic for these nouns!}
%nominal inflectional class Ic. 
As the example in \REF{nominalizerEx1} shows, these are full fledged nouns that inflect for case and number and can fill syntactic slots reserved for NPs (here, the object of the transitive verb \It{adnet} ‘have’).

\subsection{The agent nominalizer suffix \It{-däddje}}\label{agentNMLZ}\is{derivation!nominal}
The nominalizing suffix\is{suffix!derivational} \It{-däddje} (glossed as \Sc{nmlz2}) creates an agent noun, indicating that the referent of the noun is involved in the activity denoted by the base. Examples are provided in \REF{agentNMLZex1} through \REF{agentNMLZex5}.

\DerivExamWL{jåhta-t}{drive-\Sc{inf}}{báhko\PLUS jåde-däddje}{word\PLUS drive-\Sc{nmlz2}\BS\Sc{nom.sg}}{chairperson}{0109}
\z

The base is typically a verb\is{verb}, but can be a noun, as in \REF{agentNMLZex4}. The stem of the derived agent noun is in the weak grade\is{consonant gradation!weak grade}. 
As illustrated by \REF{agentNMLZex2} and \REF{agentNMLZex3}, the resulting agent noun (with a root \It{máles} and \It{åhpa}) may no longer be directly derivable from the comparable verb (there is no verb \It{*málle-t} ‘cook-\Sc{inf}’, only \It{málestit}, nor a verb \It{*åhpa-t}, but instead \It{åhpådit} ‘teach-\Sc{inf}’). 

Note that the noun \It{báhkojådedäddje} ‘chairperson’ in \REF{agentNMLZex3} is a compound calque based on the Swedish\is{language contact} equivalent \It{ordförande}, which literally means ‘word-driver’. It is not clear whether \QUES\It{jådedäddje} ‘driver’ exists on its own. 




\subsection{The state nominalizer suffix \It{-vuohta}}\label{vuohta}\is{derivation!nominal}
The nominalizing suffix\is{suffix!derivational} \It{-vuohta} (glossed as \Sc{nmlz3}) typically derives nouns from adjectives, 
%indicates a state\marginpar{better term than ‘state’?} of being the property referred to by the base, which is usually an adjective, 
as in \REF{vuohtaEx1} through \REF{vuohtaEx3}.

\ea\label{vuohtaEx3}
\DerivExamWL{luossis}{heavy}{luossis-vuohta}{heavy-\Sc{nmlz3}\BS\Sc{nom.sg}}{melancholy}{2519}
\z

The suffix \It{-vuohta} can also be applied to a derived adjectival base. In \REF{vuohtaEx5}, the stem \It{máhtelis} ‘possible’ is itself a derived adjectival based on the verb \It{máhttet} ‘can’. The deepest derivational base in the example in \REF{vuohtaEx6} is roughly analogous, but one step farther removed from the final derived form: the highest-level base \It{bargodis} ‘unemployed’ is an adjectival form of the noun \It{bargo} ‘work’, which itself is a deverbal form based on the verb \It{barrgat} ‘work’ (cf.~example \REF{NMLZ1ex1} in \SEC\ref{nmlz1} above).

\DerivExamWL{bargodis}{unemployed}{bargodis-vuohta}{unemployed-\Sc{nmlz3}\BS\Sc{nom.sg}}{unemployment}{3131}
\z

Much as with \REF{vuohtaEx6} above, the base \It{tjalmedis} ‘blind’ in \REF{vuohtaEx7} is itself based on the noun \It{tjalbme} ‘eye’ derived by the suffix \It{-dis} indicating a lack of the base referent. Thus, \It{tjalmedisvuohta} could be literally translated as ‘eye-less-ness’. 
\ea\label{vuohtaEx7}

\section{Verbal derivation}\label{vDerivation}\is{derivation!verbal|(}%include non-finite verbs here!
Verbal derivation in \PS\ is a particularly complex area, and the interested reader is first and foremost referred to Israel Ruong’s PhD thesis \It{Lappische Verbalableitung dargestellt auf Grundlage des Pitelappischen}\footnote{‘Saami verbal derivation as illustrated by the \PS\ language’ (my translation).} 
\citep{Ruong1943}. This work presents a comprehensive typology of non-derived verbs and verbal derivation suffixes in \PS. %, made possible surely in part by his native speaker intuitions and knowledge. 
It includes an extensive semantic sub-classification of the derivational suffixes into the varied and overlapping meanings each one can have. The forty suffixes Ruong presents, and the myriad functions he assigns them to, further attest to the complicated nature of verbal derivation in \PS. 

The present discussion cannot hope to improve on Ruong’s work, and instead attempts to use the \PSDP\ corpus to achieve the following: 
\begin{itemize}
\item{Using the diminutive verbalizer \It{-tj} as a starting point, illustrate the complexity of verbal derivation in \PS\ due to the persistent irregularities between forms and functions (\SEC\ref{verbDIM});}
\item{Present a sample of verbal derivations (\SEC\ref{vblzST} through \SEC\ref{vblzDALL});}
\item{Provide a basic description of the important valency-decreasing verbal derivation creating passive verb forms (\SEC\ref{VdervPassives}).}
\end{itemize}



\subsection[The diminutive verbalizer suffix \It{-tj}]{The diminutive verbalizer suffix \It{-tj} and the complexities of \PS\ derivational verb morphology}\label{verbDIM}\is{derivation!verbal}\is{diminutive}
The diminutive verbalizing suffix\is{suffix!derivational} \It{-tj} (glossed as \Sc{dim}) expresses doing the activity referred to by the verbal base a little bit or to a limited extent, as in \REF{verbDIMex1} through \REF{verbDIMex3}.\footnote{Note the similarity in form and semantics to the diminutive nominalizing suffix \It{-tj} discussed in \SEC\ref{dim}.} %It is essentially identical in form

The weak form of the base verb is selected by \It{-tj}, and the final vowel in the base becomes \It{a}. 
The \It{i} following the \It{-tj} suffix is the verb class marker for the resulting Class V verb. %, to which verbs derived by \It{-tj} belong.

In these three examples, the derivational suffixes \It{-st}, \It{-d} and \It{-dall}, respectively,\footnote{The vowel following each of these verbalizers is a class marker.} 
also derive deverbal verbs which add similar diminutive meanings to the base. 

If these suffixes were restricted to a diminutive meaning, then this would simply be a case of many forms corresponding to a single function. However, these suffixes, which are all quite common, only occasionally carry a diminutive meaning. In other instances, they impart a variety of different meanings to the base form. This is illustrated by just a few examples below, and is even more obvious throughout \citet{Ruong1943}. Despite the variety of and inconsistencies in the meanings that verbal derivational suffixes express, their limited number relative to the number of functions they fulfill is reason enough to describe each of these suffixes as a single derivational affix with multiple functions, rather than multiple, homonymous affixes, each aligned to a separate function.

In addition to the diminutive meaning in \REF{verbDIMex4} above, 
the derivational suffix\is{suffix!derivational} \It{-st} (glossed as \Sc{vblz1}) is applied to a postposition in \REF{vblzSTex1}, and functions as a verbalizer. In \REF{vblzSTex2}, the nominal base is not only verbalized, but has a causative or perhaps an inchoative meaning. The derived verb in \REF{vblzSTex3} is a figurative extension of the verbal base’s meaning. 
Furthermore, \It{-st} can indicate that an action is carried out briefly or for a short period of time, as in \REF{vblzSTex4}.

Note that the \It{i} following the \It{-st} suffix is the verb class marker for the resulting Class V verb. 



\subsection{The verbal derivational suffix \It{-d}}\label{vblzD}\is{derivation!verbal}
In addition to the diminutive meaning in \REF{verbDIMex5} above, 
each of the two examples of the verbalizer\is{suffix!derivational} \It{-d} (glossed as \Sc{vblz2}) in \REF{vblzDex1} and \REF{vblzDex2} has a reflexive meaning; note that the base in \REF{vblzDex2} is a noun, not a verb. The example in \REF{vblzDex4} has a transitivizing effect on the verbal base, while there is no clear difference in meaning between the base and the resulting derived form in \REF{vblzDex5} and \REF{vblzDex5b}. The last example, \It{sykel}\footnote{< Swedish\is{language contact} \It{cykel} ‘bicycle’.} 
‘bicycle’ in \REF{vblzDex6}, illustrates that this suffix is quite productive, as it is used as a verbalizer for a loanword serving as a nominal base. 
Note that the \It{i} following the \It{-d} suffix is the verb class marker for the resulting Class V verb.

\subsection{The verbal derivational suffix \It{-dall}}\label{vblzDALL}\is{derivation!verbal}
In addition to the diminutive meaning in \REF{verbDIMex6} above, 
the first two examples \mbox{(\ref{vblzDALLex1}--\ref{vblzDALLex2})} of the verbalizer\is{suffix!derivational} \It{-dall} (glossed as \Sc{vblz3}) show deadjectival verbs which express being characterized by the base adjective. The adjectival base is even semantically restricted in the derived form in example \REF{vblzDALLex2}. 
Similarly, the denominal verb in \REF{vblzDALLex3} is based on the \Sc{3}\SGs.\NOMs\ reflexive pronoun \It{etjas} ‘oneself’, and expresses a more forceful state of being the meaning of the base noun. The final two examples also restrict the semantic scope of the verbal base. 
The \It{a} following the \It{-dall} suffix is the verb class marker for the resulting Class IIa verb.

\subsection{Passivization with the derivational suffix \It{-duvv}}\label{VdervPassives}\is{passive}\is{derivation!verbal}
Transitive\is{valency!transitive} verbs can be passivized using the suffix\is{suffix!derivational} \It{-duvv} (glossed as \Sc{pass}). %\marginpar{or only \Bf{-uvvu}, with \Bf{-t-} as \Sc{inf}?}, %JW: decided to ignore this possibility
The resulting derived verb belongs to the inflectional verb Class IV, and thus features the class marker \It{-a} following the passivizing suffix in the infinitive form, and \It{-u} in the perfect form. 
For instance, compare the verb in \REF{passEx2} (in the active voice) with the equivalent passivized verb in \REF{passEx3}, including the oblique agent (in \ELAT\ case). %in the passive construction in \REF{passEx4}.

Passivization is a valency-decreasing device because the resulting verb is intransitive\is{valency!intransitive}, as it only features the patient-like argument as its sole core argument in nominative case. Note that \citet[92]{Svonni2009} claims, for North Saami, that “one cannot indicate the agent in any way” (my translation) in passive clauses using the cognate North Saami passivizing suffix. \PS\ differs significantly from North Saami in this respect, as Ruong -- himself a native speaker of \PS\ -- verifies \citep[cf.][41]{Ruong1943}. It is very possible that the \PS\ strategy of placing the agent in an oblique case could be due to extensive language contact\is{language contact} with Swedish, a language which clearly allows the agent in a passivized clause to be expressed obliquely using a prepositional phrase headed by the preposition \It{av} ‘of, from’. 
Indeed, Swedish PPs headed by \It{av} in other contexts are best translated into \PS\ as an NP in elative case, the same oblique case in which the agent NP in a passive \PS\ sentence is found. 
%Moreover, \PS\ NPs in \ELAT\ case are often translated into Swedish as a PP with \It{av} ‘from’ as the phrasal head; this is the sam preposition used to head a PP indicating the agent in passive Swedish sentences. 
%It should be noted that the passive examples in the corpus with agents in \ELAT\ case are all from translational elicitation sessions conducted mainly in Swedish, and Swedish triggers used to elicit these examples (such as \It{kåtan ställdes upp av barnen} ‘the tent was set up by the children’) may also have affected speakers’ judgment and production of \PS\ grammatical structures. 

Some other examples of transitive verbs and their passivized equivalents using \It{-duvv} are shown in \REF{vblzDUVVex1} through \REF{vblzDUVVex3}.

There are not sufficient data in the corpus to state any more about passive derivation, particularly concerning morphophonological effects of passivization on verb stems, and this and other related topics must be left for future study. The reader is referred to \citet{Ruong1943} for a more thorough morphological and semantic account of \PS\ passives. 
Inflectional aspects of passivized verbs are treated in \SEC\ref{passiveVinflection}, while syntactic aspects of clauses with passive verbs are presented briefly in \SEC\ref{passiveVoice}. 

Note that the derivational suffix \It{-duvv} can have meanings other than passive when attached to a nominal or adjectival base. Typically it then expresses a change of state that is related to the referent of the root involved. A few examples are provided in \REF{vblzDUVVex5} through \REF{vblzDUVVex8}.

\section{Adjectival derivation}\label{adjDerivation}\is{derivation!adjectival|(}
Only two derivational processes exist for adjectivals: the non-productive derivation of adjectives by\is{suffix!derivational} \It{-s}, and the productive derivation of ordinal numerals from cardinal ones. 
%, and the first, concerning the formation of adjectives is likely no longer productive. The latter concerns the derivation of ordinal numerals from cardinal numerals. 
These are described below. 

\subsection{Adjective derivation}\label{ATTRadjDerivation}
It seems conceivable that adjectives can be derived by the suffix \mbox{\It{-s}} (glossed as \Sc{adjz}). 
For instance, \It{bahá} is a nominal meaning ‘evil’, as in \REF{derivADJex1}, and \It{bahás} is the equivalent attributive adjective form, as in \REF{derivADJex2}. 
\ea\label{derivADJex1}
\glll	dat almatj lä bahá\\
	d-a-t almatj lä bahá\\
	\Sc{dem}-\Sc{dist}-\Sc{nom.sg} person\BS\Sc{nom.sg} be\BS\Sc{3sg.prs} evil\BS\Sc{nom.sg} \\\nopagebreak
\Transl{That person is evil.}{}	\CorpusE{090926}{13m36s}
\z
\ea\label{derivADJex2}
\glll	bahás almatj\\
	bahá-s almatj\\
	evil-\Sc{adjz} person\BS\Sc{nom.sg}\\\nopagebreak
\Transl{evil person}{}	\CorpusE{090926}{13m40s}
\z
In addition, the nominalized form \It{bahá-k} ‘evil’ can be further derived into an adjective \It{bahágis} ‘painful’ as in \REF{derivADJex3}. %, although it is not clear if this is an attributive or a predicative adjective. 
\ea\label{derivADJex3}
\DerivExamWL{bahá-k}{evil-\Sc{nmlz}}{bahá-gi-s}{evil-\Sc{nmlz}-\Sc{adjz}}{painful}{0102}
\z

However, as pointed out in detail in \SEC\ref{adjectivesATTR} through \SEC\ref{notePredNounsAdjs}, not all adjectives follow this pattern. In fact, based on the current data, the \It{-s} suffix marks attributive adjectives (as in \REF{derivADJex2}) and as well as predicative adjectives, %or even if it is %\marginpar{find out if \Bf{-s} is productive!} 
and, synchronically, it is not considered to be productive for either attributive or predicative forms at all. 



\subsection{Ordinal numeral derivation with \It{-át}}\label{ordNUMderiv}\is{derivation!numeral}
Numerals, a sub-category of adjectivals (cf.~\SEC\ref{numerals}), are subject to derivation. 
%\subsection{Numeral Derivation}\label{numDerivation}
The basic ordinal\is{numeral!ordinal} numerals can be derived by applying the derivational suffix \It{-át} (or its allomorph \It{-et}) %\TILDE\It{-et} %just gonna consider -et an allomorph
to the respective cardinal numeral, although the forms \It{vuostas} ‘first’ and \It{mubbe} ‘second’ are suppletive. Ordinal derivation is discussed in \SEC\ref{ordinalNums} in more detail, including a comparison of cardinal and ordinal numbers in Table~\vref{basicNumsTable}. 
\is{derivation!adjectival|)}




\section{Adverbial derivation}\label{advDerivation}\is{derivation!adverbial}
Adverbs are not common in the corpus (as opposed to other word classes and phrase types with adverbial functions), but do appear to be derivable from an adjective base using the suffix\is{suffix!derivational} \It{-git}. This is dealt with in more detail in \SEC\ref{derivedADVs}.
