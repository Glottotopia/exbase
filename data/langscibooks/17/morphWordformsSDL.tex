\chapter{Morphological patterns and word classes}\label{morphWordClassCh}
Morphology plays an essential role in \PS, a highly synthetic language. Based on morphological patterning and in addition to syntactic criteria, seven word classes can be posited. \SEC\ref{morphology} first provides an introduction to morphological phenomena in \PS, before \SEC\ref{introWordForms} summarizes the word classes.  


\section{Overview of morphology}\label{morphology}
A number of inflectional categories exist in \PS; Table~\vref{summaryMorphCats} provides a summary of inflectional categories relevant for each sub-category of the relevant word classes. 
\begin{table}[htb]\centering

Derivational morphology is commonly used to create nouns, verbs, and, to a lesser extent, adjectives and adverbs. %\footnote{\Red{Historically, at least attributive adjectives were probably derived as well, but synchronically, this is no longer the case; cf.~\SEC\ref{notePredNounsAdjs}.}} 
Both derivational\is{derivation} and inflectional\is{inflection} morphology manifest themselves linearly (by suffixing) or non-linearly, via consonant gradation, umlaut and/or vowel harmony. More often than not, linear and non-linear morphological phenomena are combined. 

The present section only provides an overview of these various morphological phenomena, and is divided into \SEC\ref{linearMorphology} on linear morphology and \SEC\ref{morphophonology} on non-linear morphological processes. %(consonant gradation, umlaut and morphologically-triggered vowel harmony).
Because morphological behavior varies between the word classes, it is described in more detail individually in the relevant word class chapters.

\subsection{Linear morphology}\label{linearMorphology}\is{morphology!linear|(}
Concerning linearly separable morphology, \PS\ is an exclusively suffixing language. Both inflectional and derivational suffixes exist. %, and can be ascertained on nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, verbs. 
According to the general linear morphological structure of \PS\ words, derivational suffixes attach to a root before inflectional suffixes occur on the resulting stem, as illustrated in \REF{linearMorphStructure}.

%


\subsection{Non-linear morphology (morphophonology)}\label{morphophonology}\is{morphology!non-linear|(}
There are three ways %\marginpar{mention stem extension for verb morphology?} %eigentlich ja.
in which non-linear morphology can be expressed in \PS:
\begin{itemize}
\item{stem consonant alternations (consonant gradation)}
\item{stem vowel alternations in V1 position (umlaut)}
\item{regressive vowel harmony in V1 and V2 vowels}
\end{itemize}
These are triggered by a word’s position %paradigmatic relationship 
within an inflectional paradigm, or in derivation. All inflectional non-linear morphology is restricted to the final foot\is{foot} of a given word, while derivational non-linear morphology can also occur in a non-ultimate foot. Non-linear processes may apply simultaneously. The following sections describe these phenomena in more detail: \SEC\ref{Cgrad} for consonant gradation, \SEC\ref{umlaut} for umlaut and \SEC\ref{VH} for vowel harmony.\footnote{Cf.~\citet{KorhonenM1969} for historical explanations of these morphophonological processes in Saami.} 


\subsubsection{Consonant gradation}\label{Cgrad}\is{consonant gradation|(}
The term \It{consonant gradation}\footnote{This term is quite common in Saami linguistics, e.g.,~in \citet{Feist2010}, although it is also known as ‘grade alternation’, e.g.,~in \citet{Sammallahti1998}. As much of the literature on Saami linguistics is in languages other than English, it may be useful to provide some translations of the term ‘consonant gradation’: German: \It{Stufenwechsel}, Swedish: \It{stadieväxling}, Finnish: \It{astevaihtelu}, Hungarian: \It{fokváltakozás} and Russian: \It{чередование ступеней}.} 
refers to regular alternations of the consonant phonemes in the consonant center of the final foot of a word.\footnote{Cf.~\SEC\ref{prosodicDomains} on prosodic positions, including the foot and the consonant center.} 
%Many, but not all, lexical items are subject to consonant gradation. 

All consonant phonemes in the consonant center are included in the present classification of such alternations.
These alternations come in pairs of stem allomorphs that differ quantitatively and/or qualitatively. 
Alternations can be between a preaspirated\is{aspiration!preaspiration} and the corresponding non-aspirated consonant \mbox{(ʰx\Div x)},  
 a geminate\is{geminate} consonant and the corresponding singleton consonant \mbox{(xː\Div x)}, 
 a geminate\PLUS singleton and the corresponding singleton\PLUS singleton \mbox{(xːy\Div xy)}, 
 two singletons and only the latter singleton \mbox{(xy\Div y)}, 
and  three singletons and only the initial and final singleton \mbox{(xyz\Div xz)}.\footnote{There are certainly other ways to classify these alternations in the consonant center as well. For instance, one could disregard any consonant phonemes that are present in both alternations (then \mbox{xː\Div x} and \mbox{xːy\Div xy} would be the same type), or consider the xː\Div x and ʰxː\Div x patterns in Table~\ref{CgradPatternSummary} to be the same type as simply a case of alternating consonant phonemes. However, the patterns in the present classification demonstrate the regularity of patterning between phonological features (such as geminate vs. singleton).}  

These patterns and the attested alternations are provided in Table~\vref{CgradPatternSummary}.

The term \It{strong grade}\is{consonant gradation!strong grade} (abbreviated ‘str’) is used to refer to the form with preaspiration\is{aspiration!preaspiration}, a geminate\is{geminate} or more consonant segments than the corresponding form. Likewise, the term \It{weak grade}\is{consonant gradation!weak grade} (abbreviated ‘wk’) refers to the form lacking a preaspirated or geminate consonant, or having fewer consonant segments, respectively. 
To facilitate reading Table~\ref{CgradPatternSummary}, the attested alternations for each pattern are organized by alternations with a non-aspirated element first, followed by patterns with at least one preaspirated element. Furthermore, the individual lists of alternations are organized by mode of articulation and by the order set forth in the consonant phoneme inventory in Table~\vref{Cphonemes}. 
Some examples illustrating this can be found below. 


The minimal pair in \REF{CgradEx3} shows a consonant gradation alternation \mbox{/ʰp\Div p/}, which corresponds to the pattern \mbox{ʰx\Div x}. %in Table~\ref{CgradPatternSummary}.

%In the first example, a geminate /vː/ in the consonant center of the \Sc{3sg.prs} form alternates with a singleton /v/ in the \Sc{2sg.prs} form. In the latter example, geminate\PLUS singleton /rːk/ in \Sc{nom.sg} alternates with two singeltons /rk/ in \Sc{nom.pl}.

As may be inferred from the examples above, paradigmatic alternations between \mbox{\Sc{nom.sg}} and \mbox{\Sc{nom.pl}} forms for nouns, or between \Sc{2sg.prs} and \Sc{3sg.prs} forms for verbs are often a good source of minimal pairs concerning consonant gradation alternations, and are a useful way to determine consonant gradation patterns. 

Note that the geminate\is{geminate} plosives\is{plosive} and affricates\is{affricate} \mbox{\ipa{/pː\,tː\,kː\,ʦː\,ʧː/}} are lacking in Table~\vref{CgradPatternSummary} for the pattern \mbox{xː\Div x}, although alternations such as \mbox{\ipa{pː\Div p}} could be expected. However, due to a lack of sufficient data and some conflicting data in the corpus, it is not entirely clear what the current status is for consonant gradation in words with a consonant center consisting solely of a geminate plosive or affricate. The fact that \PS\ lacks consonant gradation in a limited number of contexts is one of the main differences to Lule Saami to the north, which does not lack consonant gradation, and Ume Saami to the south, which features consonant gradation even less frequently \citep[cf.][21--23]{Sammallahti1998}. 
The example in \REF{CgradEx4a} illustrates a word clearly lacking consonant gradation in the corpus data, here with the geminate velar plosive \ipa{/kː/}.

Corpus data also indicate that variation within the \PS\ area complicates things. For instance, the adjective \It{tjábbe} ‘beautiful’ undergoes consonant gradation in the speech\is{dialect variation} of speakers from the northern parts of Arjeplog, but does not for southern speakers, as illustrated in \REF{CgradEx4b}. For northern speakers, the gradation is realized as an alternation in voicing, and not length.

\z
This being the case, some speakers from farther north may have further voiced plosive phonemes \mbox{\ipa{/bː dː gː/}} that only occur in consonant gradation alternations with the corresponding unvoiced phonemes \mbox{\ipa{/pː tː kː/}}. However, it is not clear based on the corpus data how widespread this feature is, or if it also affects geminate affricates. 

Finally, it is not clear from the corpus data what the status of the phonological contexts lacking consonant gradation mentioned in \citet[21]{Sammallahti1998} (working from a historical perspective and with older data) is. Further research is needed to complete the picture, and %, although due to the current state of the \PS\ language \citep[cf.][]{ValijarviWilbur2011}, gathering such data is becoming more and more difficult; 
variation within \PS\ and possible effects of language attrition should also be taken into consideration.\is{consonant gradation|)}



\subsubsection{Umlaut}\label{umlaut}\is{umlaut|(}
The term \It{umlaut} refers to regular allomorphic alternations of the vowels in the V1 position of a stem.\footnote{Cf.~\SEC\ref{prosodicDomains} on prosodic positions, including V1 position.} 
The two umlaut patterns attested in the corpus are listed in Table~\vref{umlautPatternSummary}. %\footnote{Due to the orthography being more phonetic than phonemic, particularly concerning umlaut, phonemic representations in IPA are used in Table~\vref{umlautPatternSummary}. However, these umlaut alternations are typically represented orthographically by the graphemes \It{ä}\TILDE\It{ie} and \It{ua}\TILDE\It{uo}, respectively. Cf.~\SEC\ref{orthography} on the orthographic representation of \PS.} %Generally speaking, in V1 position, /u͡a/ is spelled \It{u͡a}, and its allophone [uɛ] is spelled \It{uä}, while /o/ is spelled \It{uo}, but /e/ is spelled \It{e} or \It{ie}.}

These umlaut alternations are qualitative and not quantitative. %The first one consists of a pair, and the second a triplet. 
These alternations are not triggered by the phonological environment, but instead morphologically. 
The allomorph \ipa{/ɛ/} in the first pattern is found in the same paradigmatic slots for each inflectional class as \ipa{/u͡a/}\footnote{Note that \ipa{/u͡a/} has an allomorph \ipa{[u͡ɛ]} triggered by purely phonological vowel harmony; cf.~\SEC\ref{Vua}.} 
in the second pattern, just as the allomorphs \ipa{/e/} and \ipa{/o/} also correspond to the same paradigmatic slots.

\subsubsection{Vowel harmony}\label{VH}\is{vowel harmony|(}
The term \It{vowel harmony} (abbreviated ‘VH’) here refers to non-adjacent regressive phonological assimilation\is{assimilation} concerning the place of articulation of the V1 vowel of a stem in the context of certain V2 vowels.\footnote{Cf.~\SEC\ref{prosodicDomains} on prosodic positions, including V1 and V2 positions.} 
Specifically, mid-high or high front vowels in V2 position in specific paradigmatic slots trigger raising of the vowel in V1 position. Because the paradigmatic slots that trigger vowel harmony differ between word classes and inflectional classes, and do not apply across the board, vowel harmony is not a purely phonological process, but morphophonological. Furthermore, the results of harmony on the same underlying vowel are inconsistent, and may be due to a word’s membership is certain morphological classes concerning vowel harmony. However, future research must be conducted to come to a more thorough conclusion on this. 

Verbs\is{verb} and nouns\is{noun} can be subject to vowel harmony, but the assimilation patterns vary both between these word classes and within them. 
Table~\vref{VHsummaryTable} summarizes the various patterns and the word classes that they are attested in based on the current corpus.

The morphological categories that trigger vowel harmony also vary. This is the case not only between nouns and verbs (as these have different inflectional categories), but also between inflectional classes for verbs. These categories are presented in Table~\vref{VHtriggerSummary}. %on page \pageref{VHtriggerSummary}.

\section{Overview of word classes}\label{introWordForms}\is{word class (overview)}
By characterizing the morphological and syntactic behavior of words in \PS, and grouping such words based on that behavior, a total of seven word classes can be distinguished. These can be divided into two general categories containing generally \It{open} word classes and \It{closed} word classes, and are listed in Table~\vref{wordClassList}. 
The specific syntactic criteria and inflectional\is{inflection} categories defining these are summarized in Table~\vref{wordClassSummary1}.

Some word classes consist of two or more subclasses: 
\It{nominals} refer to \It{nouns} %(including a subcategory for predicative adjectives) 
and \It{pronouns} (personal, demonstrative, reflexive, interrogative and relative), and \It{adjectivals} include both \It{adjectives} and \It{numerals}. %Sets of finite and non-finite \It{verbs} belong to the same lexeme. 
Note that pronouns and numerals are closed subclasses belonging to open classes.

This categorization is intended to provide a broad starting point for classifying \PS\ words; details for each word class can be found in the relevant chapters below. 
%Although nouns and pronouns are both considered nominals, they are dealt with in separate chapters for the sake of clarity. 
Chapter \ref{nouns} concerns the nominal subclass \It{nouns}, which provide fairly straightforward examples of the morphophonological complexities involved in \PS\ inflection and derivation, while 
the nominal subclass \It{pronouns} is dealt with in Chapter \ref{pronouns}. % for the sake of clarity. 
Chapter \ref{adjectivesIntro} then covers the adjectival subclasses \It{adjectives} and \It{numerals}. Following this, Chapter \ref{verbs} deals with \It{verbs}. Finally, the remaining small classes (\It{adverbials}, \It{adpositions}, \It{conjunctions} %, \It{particles}, 
and \It{interjections}) are covered in Chapter \ref{otherWordClasses}.
